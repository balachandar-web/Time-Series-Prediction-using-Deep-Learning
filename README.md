This project aims to develop a predictive model using a deep learning framework (TensorFlow) to forecast future sales from historical time series data. The model is designed to accurately predict future time steps using monthly sales data from a retail chain, spanning from 2015 to 2020. The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, training, validation, and evaluation.
